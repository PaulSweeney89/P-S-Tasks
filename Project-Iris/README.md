##Project Iris

**Programming & Scripting Project 2020**

*Research of the Fisher's Iris dataset and the developement of a program to read and analyize the dataset.*

#Introduction

This project forms part of the programming & scripting module for 2020, please refer to the project.pdf document included in this repository for the full project outline & instructions.

The project is conducted under 3 main sections:

- Research of the Fisher's Iris dataset, including an overview of the dataset & a brief description of any new topics or terminologies encountered within the subject matter.

- Development of the python program for the import, cleaning & analysis of the dataset, including explanations of the code developed, reasons for choice of code used along with highlighting any limitations within code. 

- Analysis of the dataset & review of the program outputs, reporting on & summarizing any findings within the dataset & project.

#Research

The Iris flower dataset or Fisher's Iris dataset was introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936.
There are over 250 varieties of the iris flower and they come in a wide range of colours, the greek word iris means rainbow.

Fisher's data set contains 3 species of the Iris plant: 

	- Iris setosa 
	- Iris virginica 
	- Iris versicolor
 
Fifty samples of each of the 3 species were taken, with 4 characteristics of the flowers measured, the species of the flower was also included as a 5th attribute within the dataset.

	(1) sepal length (cm)
	(2) sepal width (cm)
	(3) pedal length (cm)
	(4) pedal width (cm)
	(5) species
 
Therefore there is 50 samples for each of the 3 species of Iris, each with 5 attributes giving a total number of 50 x 3 x 5 = 750 data points within Fischer's dataset.

From the dataset Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the 3 species from each other.
